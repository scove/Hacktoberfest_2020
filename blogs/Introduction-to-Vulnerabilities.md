<h1 align="center">Introduction to Software Vulnerabilities</h1>

##Introduction
With the world becoming ever more dependent on computer systems, the need to protect data, information technology infastructure, and business critical applications becomes increasingly more obvious. Software vulnerabilities are discovered everyday and the exploitation of these flaws are responsible for a projected six trillion dollars (USD) by 2021 (https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/). Education into developing software with security in mind can help reduce the massive costs of security breaches that are inneabled through software faults.

##Types of Vulnerabilities
|Type | Description |
|---------|------------|
|Buffer Overflow | asd |
|OS Command Injection| asd |
|SQL Injection|
|Cross Site Scripting|
|Cross Site Request Forgery|
|URL Redirection|
|Path Traversal| One of my favorites, allows the attacker to travese a directory that they should not have access to. For example if files are uploaded on a server in the /usr/uploads directory, a malicous actor can navigate through unsanitized input, to the /usr directory and other sub directories.|
|Unrestricted Upload of Malicous Files|
